I also want to have the ability/feature to show clipboard item previews before pasting. I want clipboard image saving (with optional compression, to save space in our database, which should have options and settings for the user to choose how compressed the images are). We also need the ability for users to be able to edit the items in their clipboard history, which should be either handled by autosaving or a save button (pick one to default to that makes it easier for the user which is probably autosaving, but make an option for the user to switch this setting to the other method of saving, and there should be an autosave timer in seconds that the user can select for the app to use as a setting). We also might want to have a setting where the user can change how often the clipboard is monitored (instant, every second, every half second, something like that maybe?). We also want an auto-cleanup function (off by default) where the app deletes any items older than a set amount of days (set to 60 days by default) or when it goes beyond the maximum amount of items allowed in history as set by that configuration setting (100 by default, 1000 maximum). We should also have an optional feature where you have to set a password to encrypt the history and then anything past the last 10 history items are encrypted unless you put in the password as set earlier by the user. If we can we also want a nice app icon for this app, I would prefer a cat face with a paperclip.
